# timelapse

## Overview
A series of scripts in Bash and Perl to produce a timelapse image of something, given the right environment.

## Motivation
Part of Earlham's expansion has been the construction of new buildings, among them our new (dedication October 2016) science building. This webcam project filmed its construction. It builds on other webcam projects going back as far as 2003.

I would note that this was the first package of code I wrote for any project. It shows. In the interest of time, I have included them unaltered just the same. When we next have a webcam project we will update again.

## Installation and Usage
Download and run as you typically do scripts of these kinds. They require minimum adaptation (IP addresses, etc.).

## History
Each script includes its individual contributors over time, but Ivan Babic, Charlie Peck, and Craig Earley wrote most of the code.
